# PE file Structure
Every operating system has respective file structures which are built and developed as per the requirement. Ever since the beginning of Microsoft Windows, there have been many updates for the file structure evolving from DOS, NE, LX to the current  PE structure. We will be dealing here with PE structure.
PE stands for **Portable Executable**.  This is the standard file structure used in windows operating systems. This structure is adopted for DLLs(32bit and 64bit), windows executables, .NET executables and few more. 
## The Basic Structure
Every PE has a DOS header, then comes the PE headers followed by the section table. These sections include .text , .bss, .rdata., .data,  .rsc, .idata, .edata, .debug, and .pdata. It's not necessary that all these sections have to be present.

This DOS headers is to make sure a backward compatibility to MS-DOS. If the program runs on MS-DOS then it will run and print that this is not for MS-DOS mode program and exit without any errors. Its 64 BYTES long.

DOS header is a predefined structure of windows with 19 members. 
## DOS header members:

```
e_magic
e_cblp
e_cp
e_crlc
e_cparhdr
e_minalloc
e_maxalloc
e_ss
e_sp
e_csum
e_ip
e_ip
e_ifarlc
e_ovna
e_res
e_oemid
e_oeminfo
e_res2
e_lfanew
```

Out of these, the important ones are 
- e_magic - the letters MZ (Mark Zbikowsky) which is the MS-DOS header

- e_lfanew - contains the offset to PE header with respect to the file.


## PE headers
It is again a structure defined as below:

```
 IMAGE_NT_HEADERS STRUCT {
	Signature
	FileHeader
	OptionalHeader
}
```

- Signature contains 4 bytes  PE followed by two terminating zeros.
```
50 45 00 00
```

- File header is again a structure: 

```
IMAGE_FILE_HEADER_STRUCT{
Machine
NumberOfSections
TimeDateStamp
PointerToSymbolTable
NumberOfSymbols
SizeOfOptionalHeader
Characteristics
}
```

These all are mainly the physical layout of file, filling `120 bytes` of the PE file.

- `Machine` basically tells the targetted machine for that executable.

- `NumberofSections` this is an important parameter. Incase if any section is added/deleted then Corresponding changes must be made here too.

- `Characteristics` - This contains few important details, such as flags to know whether the file is a DLL or an exe.


## Optional Header 
It is the next `224 bytes`. 

It has lot of details...

```
IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER_STRUCT {
  Magic
  MajorLinkerVersion
  MinorLinkerVersion
  SizeOfCode
  SizeOfInitializedData
  SizeOfUninitializedData
  AddressOfEntryPoint
  BaseOfCode
  BaseOfData
  ImageBase
  SectionAlignment
  FileAlignment
  MajorOperatingSystemVersion
  MinorOperatingSystemVersion
  MajorImageVersion
  MinorImageVersion
  MajorSubsystemVersion
  MinorSubsystemVersion
  Win32VersionValue
  SizeOfImage
  SizeOfHeaders
  CheckSum
  Subsystem
  DllCharacteristics
  SizeOfStackReserve
  SizeOfStackCommit
  SizeOfHeapReserve
  SizeOfHeapCommit
  LoaderFlags
  NumberOfRvaAndSizes
  DataDirectory
}
```

- `Magic` Identifies whether its is:
  - PE32 - 0x10b
  - ROM image - 0x107
  - PE32+ (64 bit)  - 0X20B

- `major and minor linker version`, as the name suggests can be used to itentify the linker version. [such as visual studio version]

- `SizeOfCode` is basically ther size of the entire Code/Text section. 

- `SizeOfInitializedData` size of the whole initialised data - entire data section.
- `SizeOfUninitializedData(BSS)` size of the whole uninitialised data - entire .bss section.

- `AddressOfEntryPoint` is with respect to the image base when its loaded in the memory. Its basically the RVA of the first instruction to be executed. 
  - If the flow of the Instruction has to be altered from the start then this shall be changes. 
  - Incase in packers this will be pointing to the decompression stub then later on jump instruction to the original entry point.

- `BaseOfCode` is the offset to the starting of the code/text section from the imagebase.

- `BaseOfData` is the offset to the starting of the data section from the imagebase. [absent in PE 32+]

- `ImageBase` is the preferred address of the imageâ€™s starting byte when loaded in the memory.(Mostly 0x400000)

- `Alignment`
  - There are two alignments taking place which are `Section` and `file` alignment. 
  - `Section alignment` is for the executable present in the memory and  `file alignment` is for the file present on the disk. 

### Data Directory

The Next Important is the last member of the optional headers, that is DataDirectory. Its the last 128 bytes of the optional headers, having 16 structures, 8 bytes each.

```
IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY_STRUCT {
  DWORD VirtualAddress
  DWORD Size
}
```

The various directories with these two values includ Export directories, Import directories, Resource directories, debug directories, TLS and more. 

## Section Table

After this we have Section table, which can be found immediatly after the optional headers.
  - The no. of entries here is determined by NoOfSections in file header.
  - Each entry is a corresponding section header.
  - Per entry is 40 bytes.
  ```
  IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER_STRUCT{
    Name
    VirtualSize
    VirtualAddress
    SizeOfRawData
    PointerToRawData
    PointerToRelocation
    PointerToLineNumber
    NumberOfRelocations
    NumberOfLineNumbers 
    Characteristics 
  }
```
 - `Name` - name of that section
 - `VirtualSize` - size of the section in memory.
 - `VirtualAddress` - Address of the first byte of the section realtive to Imagebase in memory.
 - `SizeOfRawData` - size of the section on disk. 
 - `PointerToRawData` - Offset from the file's starting to the section.
 - `Characteristics` -  Contains flags indicating whether the section is executable, or has initialised data, uninitialised data and all.

 After the section headers we have the sections. Each section starts with offset being the multiple of the `filealignment`s.
 Between each sections there will be 00 padding.

 ## Sections
 ### 1 .text Contains the code
 ### 2 .rdata Contains the read-only data
 ### 3 .bss Contains the uninitialised data
 ### 4 .data All the other variables
 ### 5 .debug Contains the debug information
 ### 6 .edata Contains the export infomrmation such the names and addresses of the functions that can be exported.
 ### 7 .idata Contains the import infomrmation such the  names and addresses of functions that imported.
 ### 8 .rsrc This contains the resourse information such the icon for the application.
 ### 9 .reloc This is needed to enable the ASLR in the executable.
 ### 10 .pdata

## The export section

The functions in a DLL can be exported in two ways:
  - By name 
  - By ordinal 

Ordinal is a 16 bit Word, number which uniquely identifies a function in dll.
 ***GetProcAddress*** is used to call the function present in the DLL either by name or by oridinal. This function returns the address of the respective function.

 ***GetProcAddress***  does this with help of well structured export directory(11 members) which has the required information.

 ```
IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY{
  Characteristics
  TimeDateStamp
  MajorVersion
  MinorVersion
  nName
  nBase
  NumberOfFunctions
  NumberOfNames
  AddressOfFunctions
  AddressOfNames
  AddressOfNameOrdinals
}
 ```

`AddressOfFunctions(EAT)`, `AddressOfNames(ENT)` & `AddressOfNameOrdinals(EOT)` are arrays having the mentioned informations. 
- To get a function address the OS will go through the ENT & EAT together, when it encounters the needed function name, it will fetch the oridinal from EOT and use it to index the function from EAT.
- If we have an ordinal then function can be directly indexed from EAT.
- nBase - has the base value of the ordinal and the OS subtracts this to get the index from EAT.

***Export Forwarding***- A method to export a function from a DLL which actually belongs to a different DLL. Here the EAT will have a pointer to an ascii string of the DLL and function name ie an address inside the export section.
